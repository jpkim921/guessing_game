# Guessing Game House Contract
This repo is the smart contract for the [Guessing Game](https://github.com/jpkim921/guessing_game_fe). This smart contract acts like the house for the game.

# To Start
 - run `npm install`
 - compile `npx hardhat compile`
 - run local node `npx hardhat node`
 - deploy contract `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_house.js --network localhost`

 - if needed add hardhat network to metamask wallet [How to add a custom network RPC](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC). The information needed to add will be in the terminal/shell when you run the local node.
